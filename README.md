# Bidirectional-Associative-Memory
A simple implementation of BAM (Bidirectional Associative Memory) from scratch in Python 3 with a simple example.

## Problem Statement :clipboard:

Given

- **Set A**:  
    - X1 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    - X2 = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]
    - X3 = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1 ]
    - X4 = [1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1]
<br><br>

- **Set B**:  
    - Y1 = [1, 1, 1]
    - Y2 = [-1, -1, -1]
    - Y3 = [-1, 1, 1]
    - Y4 = [1, -1, 1]


- Using BAM algorithm, **train a W matrix for BAM** which can retrieve all the above mentioned 4 pairs. 
- Hence test the level of weight corrections of the BAM with examples.

## Usage :spades:

- Ensure that **jupyter notebook** is installed on your system.
- Open up jupyter notebook and simple execute the cells.

## Note :pushpin:

- Programming Language: **Python 3**
- The **"numpy"** module is required. To install, type the following command in terminal: **pip install numpy**
